\begin{abstract}
  An abstract is used to convey your idea succintly. An efficient abstract is
  made up of four sentences. First, state the problem. Then state the
  consequence of the problem. Next, state how you propose to solve the problem
  and finally, state the consequence of your solution. The consequence is
  usually how the performance is improved by implementing your solution.
